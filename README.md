# Kappa-language_bison
The project involves designing and implementing the initial stages of a compiler for the fictional programming language called Kappa.

The task is to create a source-to-source compiler, also known as a trans-compiler or transpiler, which takes the source code of a program written in the Kappa programming language as input and produces equivalent source code in another programming language, in this case, the well-known C programming language.

In this project the syntax analyzer (parser) is implemented for the Kappa language using the bison tool, which includes converting Kappa code into C code using bison actions.

Overall, the goal of the project is to build a transpiler that translates code written in the fictional language Kappa to equivalent code in C, by utilizing syntax analysis techniques.
